# Trip Data Test 

## Introduction
#### In this repo you will find my work for the Senior Data Science Developer competition. This includes raw data which was ingested by the main.py python script, where a function was defined to update the duration fields to be in seconds. This newly updated data was then output to a parquet file for use by the business for self serve analytics. Accompanying these files is also the test_seconds.py file that uses pytest to check that the function defined in main.py correctly converts the durations to seconds.
